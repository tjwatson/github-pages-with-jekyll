# Atomos - A Module Framework With OSGi Connect

Atomos - A Java Module Runtime using OSGi Connect

With the release of [OSGi Core Release 8](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/), the [Connect](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.connect.html) Specification enables OSGi frameworks to be extended to support environments not previously possible in a standard way. Atomos uses the Connect specification to extend the use of the OSGi framework into many different environments.
